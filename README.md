# ZKPFromScratch
Exploring zero-knowledge proofs (ZKP) starting with zero knowledge â€” a journey from the ground up.

I'll put the knowledge in `ZKPFromScratch vault/` and the experimental codes in `src/`.

# Reference

Below are the most useful reference materials for me:

- [A beginner's intro to coding zero-knowledge proofs](https://dev.to/spalladino/a-beginners-intro-to-coding-zero-knowledge-proofs-c56)
is very engineer-friendly and allows for a quick comprehensive understanding of ZKP domain.
The examples in the text are concise and powerful, and it compares methods of writing ZKP in different programming languages.
- [Learn 0xPARC](https://learn.0xparc.org/) is a more complete tutorial. I am currently studying on Circom part.
- [PLONK by Hand](https://research.metastate.dev/plonk-by-hand-part-1/) shows how to execute a PLONK ZKP system completely _by hand_.

# Working on

- Translating the foundational [Number Theory](https://crypto.stanford.edu/pbc/notes/numbertheory/), essential for understanding ZKP, into Chinese. Typo errors in the original text will be corrected. Sections where the explanation jumps or lacks coherence will be annotated with additional explanations.
